Theme: Develop an API that uses machine learning to analyse payment transactions and identify suspicious activity in real-time.
Building a Real-Time Fraud Detection API to detect and curtail frauds

The data generation for the problem statement is done via mockaroo by specifying the required key values and corresponding data
types with given data range, for around 1000 records, which is generated into a csv file.

Preprocessing of data is done in order to get consistent and reliable set of data.
Some of the used preprocessing technniques are Label encoding for feature extraction.

This csv file is used as the training model against 4 algorithms:
Isolation Forest Model
ECOD Model
Autoencoder Model
LOF Model
This analysis is for a trial test data json.

But the deployoment of the API includes the implementation of Isolation Forest.
